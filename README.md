# Portfolio Piece (Tarian)

This repository contains the project for my GAM340 assignment and took nearly two months to complete and polish. This project was created in Unity 2019.4.1f1

The project is a 2D action platformer with a Unique mechanic where the player will control the position of their weapons with the mouse as well as lite bullet hell elements. The game was made in Unity with C# and uses a verity of design patterns such as singletons and pooling managers while using inheritance for enemies and weapons.

The project contains code for an animation manager with pluggable animations which would have been achieved using Unity’s ‘Scriptable Objects’. This was intended to control and manage all the animations for all the entities such as enemies and the player. Unfortunately, the project itself does not use the manager due to not being able to get the manager to work in time. In addition, the game also had a potion that would give you a random perk, however, it didn't add to the core gameplay and wouldn't add any effects if the player was maxed out on health and ammo making it unusable and was removed
