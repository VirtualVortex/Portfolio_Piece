# Portfolio Piece (Tarian)

This repository contains the project for my GAM340 assignment and took nearly two months to complete and polish. 

The project is a 2D action platformer with a Unique mechanic where the player will control the position of their weapons with the mouse. The game was made in Unity with C# and uses a verity of design patterns such as singletons and pooling managers while using inheritance for enemies and weapons.
