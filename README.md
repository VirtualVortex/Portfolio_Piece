<b>2/10/20 - Commiting the prototype to the repo</b>

Today I've started of creating a prototype for me project and committing to the repo.The repo contains basic player movement, jumping and climbing well as a blocked out level for testing


<b> 3/10/20 - Weapons and adjusting climbing</b>
  
Created a base class for the weapons while getting to experiment with inhertiance which, surprisingly, went very well. Each weapons inherists a method which set the weapons the position to the mouse curors until it is 2 units away from the player. In addition, I worked on the colliders for the shield and dagger so that the dagger can detect enemies. I also spent some time working on the player's climbing mechanics to make climbing ladders smoother.


<b> 4/10/20 - Health and enemies</b>

Created a health script that the dagger can accese and reduce the health value while destroying the object when the value is at zero. This was added to a place holder enemy game object and worked exactly as planned. Health mechanics and enemies were ment to be worked on after all the weapons where finished however, I really wanted to test out the dagger and I was not disapointed.

<b>5/10/20 - Camera movement</b>

Today I spent some time created a camera control system that would move up and down when the player did. I tried this first with Cinemahince however, I couldn't seem to get the results I wanted and so I created my own camera control system instead, which was a lot easier.
