<b>2/10/20 - Commiting the prototype to the repo</b>

Today I've started of creating a prototype for me project and committing to the repo.The repo contains basic player movement, jumping and climbing well as a blocked out level for testing


<b> 4/10/20 - Created a base class for the weapons while getting to experiment with inhertiance which, surprisingly, went very well. Each weapons inherists a method which set the weapons the position to the mouse curors until it is 2 units away from the player.
